# HRAnalyticsProject

Hey everyone!!

I hope you all are doing well.

I am excited again to share with you all my second project where I created an interactive dashboard using PowerBI.



Project: HR ANALYTICS

 

üîç Project Objective:

HR wants to create a quarterly report for 2024 in order to understand and draw insights about their employees attendance, Work From Home(WFH), Sick Leave and other details. 


üí°Insights Gained:

- Max working attendance of the employees are on Thursday & Friday(~93%)

- Monday is the day of the week where employees are doing max WFH(~13%)

- Thursday is the day of the week where employees are taking max SL(~2%)

- Overall WFH % for Apr, May, Jun (~10%)

- Overall SL % for Apr, May, Jun (~1%)


‚òë Some conclusions related to the analytics:

- Target employees to maximize Return to Office(RTO) by making it mandate/strict notice w.r.t RTO.

- Organize health check up for employees where it is seen max people are taking SL on a given date/week.

- Organize some indoor activities for employees on a bi-weekly basis.
